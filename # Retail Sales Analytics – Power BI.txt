# Retail Sales Analytics – Power BI Project

## Business Problem

The company collected retail data but lacked insight into:

- Which locations and categories drive revenue
- How much sales depend on discounts
- Seasonal trends for planning inventory
- Average order behavior across stores

Decisions were being made based on intuition instead of data.

## What I Worked on. What I did(Analytics Process)

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- I profiled raw CSV data for quality issues  
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- I also applied IQR method to detect outliers  
- I converted transaction dates for time intelligence  
- I created dimension tables (product, location, date, customer)

### 2. Data Modeling
- Designed a **star schema** with:
  - Fact table: sales transactions  
  - Dimension tables: product, location, date, customer  
- Built one-to-many relationships  
- And validated filter context behavior

### 3. DAX & Metrics
Created business KPIs:

- Total Sales  
- Total Transactions  
- Average Order Value  
- Discount Contribution  
- High-Value Sales  
- MoM Growth  
- YTD Sales

### 4. Dashboard Design
Built a 3-page interactive report:

1. **Overview** – KPIs, trend, location performance  
2. **Sales Analysis** – category & product insights  
3. **Discount Behavior** – impact of promotions

## Business Insights Discovered

- The **Butchers category within the dataset generated the highest revenue**, indicating strong customer demand and the need to prioritize inventory and supplier relationships in this segment  
- Discounts contributed only a **small portion of total sales (≈0.34 impact)**, showing that the business is not heavily reliant on promotions to drive revenue  
- Sales patterns were **relatively stable across months**, suggesting consistent demand rather than strong seasonality. Sales were relatively consistent across months.  
- Performance differences across locations highlight opportunities for sharing best practices from top stores.

## Recommendations (Way Forward)

1. Prioritize the Butchers category for:
   - Inventory availability  
   - Supplier negotiation  
   - Product variety expansion  

2. Maintain current pricing strategy since:
   - Discounts have minimal influence  
   - Customers appear value-driven rather than promotion-driven  

3. Focus on operational improvements:
   - Study high-performing locations  
   - Replicate layout and product mix  
   - Introduce cross-selling with related categories  

4. Next Analytics Steps:
   - Add profit and margin data  
   - Analyze repeat purchase behavior  
   - Introduce forecasting for stock planning
